# Project from Udacity FEND course

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, and uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for testing purposes.

# How to get started

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser and see all tests pass.
3. Inspect the code to explore how `Jasmine` is used
